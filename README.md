# Code Review

1. `Game.js:8,11-12` - Gets imported but isn't used.
2. `Game.js:82` - console.log() :)
3. `Game.js:75` - Remove code that isn't in use.
4. `Game.js` - For better readabilty you can split game.js into multiple files.
5. `Game.js:423-46` - For better performent we would suggest a switch-statement instead.
6. `Game.js:` - Existing descriptions could be more informative :)
7. `Game.js` - Unclear what controls that we are supposed to use. "Open / Close Controls" doesnt work.
8. Instructions how to play.
9. We dont really understand the game :)
10. Gives warnings when running "npm run build".
